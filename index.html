    <h2 id="infocollect">1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
    <h3>Information you provide</h3>
    <p class="short">
      In short: I collect information needed to run Breeze Control.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may include account identifiers (for sign-in), contact details you
      provide during support, and app settings you configure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This information is collected directly from you when you sign in, submit
      support requests, or use app controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sensitive information:</strong> I do not intentionally process sensitive
      personal information.
    </p>
    <h3>Operational HVAC data</h3>
    <p>
      The app and gateway process HVAC telemetry and control data (for example,
      zone temperatures, setpoints, valve state, boiler state, schedules, and
      history points) so the system can function correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data is collected automatically as part of normal app operation when
      your device communicates with the gateway and thermostat controllers.
    </p>
    <h3>Technical and security data</h3>
    <p>
      I may process technical diagnostics (for example, timestamps, request logs,
      and error events) to keep the Services reliable and secure.
    </p>

    <h2 id="infouse">2. How Do We Process Your Information?</h2>
    <p class="short">
      In short: Data is used to operate the app and keep it secure.
    </p>
    <p>I use information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate users and maintain sessions.</li>
      <li>Display live HVAC state and history.</li>
      <li>Apply schedule and control changes requested by users.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests.</li>
      <li>Protect service security and comply with law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="whoshare">3. When And With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
    <p class="short">
      In short: I share data only as required to run the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data may be processed by infrastructure and software providers used for
      hosting, networking, and authentication. I do not sell your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any third-party service provider with access to data is expected to provide
      the same or equal protection for user data as described in this policy and
      to process data only for authorized service functions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="inforetain">4. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
    <p class="short">
      In short: Data is kept only as long as needed for operation and legal obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operational telemetry and logs are retained for troubleshooting and
      reliability. Retention periods may vary by data type and system settings.
      Data is deleted or anonymized when no longer needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can request deletion of your account-related personal data by emailing
      <a href="mailto:breeze-support@burnette.io">breeze-support@burnette.io</a>.
      I will process deletion requests subject to legal, security, and fraud-prevention
      obligations.
    </p>

    <h2 id="infosafe">5. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
    <p class="short">
      In short: Reasonable technical and organizational safeguards are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      No system is 100% secure, but I use reasonable controls to reduce risk.
      Please use strong credentials and keep your devices secure.
    </p>

    <h2 id="infominors">6. Do We Collect Information From Minors?</h2>
    <p class="short">
      In short: The Services are not directed to children under 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe personal information from a child has been provided,
      contact me so I can remove it.
    </p>

    <h2 id="privacyrights">7. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
    <p class="short">
      In short: You can request access, correction, or deletion of personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have privacy rights under applicable
      laws. To make a request, email
      <a href="mailto:breeze-support@burnette.io">breeze-support@burnette.io</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where consent is the legal basis for processing, you may revoke consent by
      contacting the support email above. Revocation does not affect processing
      performed before revocation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="policyupdates">8. Do We Make Updates To This Notice?</h2>
    <p class="short">
      In short: Yes, this policy may be updated as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Last updated" date reflects the latest version.
